https://mekintosz.github.io/Alex-Kowalski-Studio/

Single-page portfolio site for an earthenware and clay works studio. The site is fully responsive and built with HTML and CSS. The design template was provided by The Odin Project and then redesigned to fit the fake client's expectations and needs.
